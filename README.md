## Life is Unfair
Life is unfair, hard, boring .. it's get even more boring when i can't code
Simply because i need to pay the ~~f***ing~~ bills and put meals on the table.. meaning i need to work, trying to get money doing things i don't like. Exchanging precious hours for pieces of paper when i want deeply to spend those hours learning something new, staring at the teminal watching all those libs getting installed, introducing new bugs, bebugging, fixing one error to end up with more errors to fix later, switching to a new GNU/Linux Distro every week, watching anime using terminal, starting a couple of projects a month then never finishing one of them, buying an Arduino Uno R3 , a raspberry pi then never build a project yet it's still on your TODOS, coding a ```hello world``` in ```Brainfuck``` .. f ~f***~
## ~~F**ck It~~
### I decided to code every day no matter what happens .. 
- Getting fired from a job i don't like because i was coding at 3 AM and i woke up late .. Hell Yeah!
- Starving because i don't have a meal and i'm jobless all i do the day long is writing some hello world programs .. hell yeah 
- Thinking about applying to dev positions but feeling i'm not good enough, maybe i apply after another 6 months .. hell yeah 
- Feeling like an imposter, fake it untill you make it comes to the rescue .. hell yeah 
- Writting a blog post about something new you're excited about and no one will read that .. hell yeah
- Questioning your choices in life after running into an annoying error/bug .. hell yeah



## What's next? What should i do ? 
- Get back on track 
- A ~~f****ing~~ protfolio for a start.
