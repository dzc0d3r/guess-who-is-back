## Life is Unfair
Life is unfair, unjust, boring .. it's get even more boring when i can't code simply because i need to pay the f*****ng bills and put meals on the table, meaning i need to work .. trying to get money doing things i don't like, exchanging precious hours for pieces of paper when i want deeply to spend those hours learning something new, staring at the teminal watching all those libs getting installed, bebuging, fixing one error to end up with more errors to fix, switching to a new Linux Distro, starting a couple of projects a month and never finishing one of them, buying an Arduino Uno R3 , a raspberry pi then never build a project, coding a ```hello world``` in ```F``` language .. F , F FFFF
## F**k It
### I decided to code every day no matter what happens .. 
- Getting fired again from a job i don't like because i was coding at 3 AM and i woke up late .. Hell Yeah!
- Starving because i don't have a meal and i'm jobless all i do the day long is writing some hello world programs .. hell yeah 
- Thinking about applying to dev positions but feeling i'm not good enough, maybe i apply after another 6 months .. hell yeah 
- Feeling like an imposter, fake it untill you make it comes to the rescue .. hell yeah 



## What's next? What should i do ? 
- A f****ing protfolio for a start.
